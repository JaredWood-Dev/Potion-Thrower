## The Game
  The game currently has only 6 levels, showcasing the vary basic dynamics of the gameplay. To control the game, you press left and right to control the angle in which Syruyar throws the potion. The space bar charges up power the longer you hold it.

### Future Plans
  There are a number of future plans for the game, some of which might be implmented but not everything will be implemented.
  - More complex levels and mechanics
  - Varying types of potions to throw
  - Limited amount of potions in stock
  - Level obstacles
  - Boss Fight?
